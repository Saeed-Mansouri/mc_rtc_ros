This ROS stack aims at providing various tools to use along mc\_rtc. The GUI (mc\_rtc\_rviz\_panel) can be built without ROS.

## Current list of tools

- **mc\_convex\_visualization** allows to publish the convex hulls of a robot as a polygon message that can be visualized in RViz
- **mc\_log\_visualization** is a tool to visualize logs generated by an mc\_rtc controller
- **mc\_rtc\_rviz\_panel** is an mc\_rtc's GUI client that can be used inside RViZ
- **mc\_rtc\_ticker** provides an RViz interface to mc\_rtc
- **mc\_surfaces\_visualization** allows to visualize a robot's surfaces within RViZ

## Dependencies

This stack requires:
- [mc\_rtc](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/mc_rtc): if building with ROS then the ROS plugin is required
- [mc\_rtc\_msgs](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/mc_rtc_msgs): required when building with ROS
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/): if building with ROS and RViz then the version that RViZ was built with; otherwise Qt4 and Qt5 are supported
- [QWT](https://qwt.sourceforge.io/) version 6.1 or later for the corresponding Qt version
